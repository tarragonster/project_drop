            <h2>Terms of Use and Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Updated February 22, 2019</p>
            <p>Welcome to the service provided by Second Screen, Inc. dba 10 Block (“10 Block”, “we”, “us”, and/or “our”). We provide a free ad-based and a paid subscription service (“Services”) that allows you to discover, watch, talk about, review and share 10 Block content streamed over the Internet to mobile devices and other connected devices, and includes all our functions and user interfaces, as well as licensed third-party content, and our software.</p>
	          <p></p>
	          <p>By using the 10 Block mobile or web apps, you have accepted these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.</p>
	          <p></p>
	          <p>Privacy Policy & Personal Data Collection<br/>This Privacy Policy has been created to provide information about our company, our mobile applications, our website and the Services to our users (“you” and/or “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth 10 Block’s policy with respect to personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) that is collected from users of the Service.</p>
	          <p></p>
	          <p>We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register for access to our Services and/or third party services (for example, username and email address produced by services such as Facebook Connect), provide us with credit card and other payment information, contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys. Where ever 10 Block collects Personal Data, we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</p>
	          <p></p>
	          <p>Free Trial<br/>You can use 10 Block Service for free, for a limited time. When your time has expired you will see a pay wall in the app. At that point you can continue using the Service for free if you complete the quick community-building task (such as inviting a friend to join you in the app or sharing a story with your contacts) when you are prompted by the app. Free use of the Service is determined by 10 Block at its sole discretion and we may limit eligibility or duration to prevent free use abuse. We reserve the right to revoke the free trial and put your account on hold in the event that we determine that you are not eligible.</p>
	          <p></p>
	          <p>Subscription<br/>Your 10 Block monthly subscription automatically renews until terminated. To subscribe to the 10 Block service you need Internet access and a current, valid credit card (“Payment Method”). You must cancel your membership before it renews each month in order to avoid further billing. To view your monthly subscription details, see "Billing" in the app settings. You can cancel your 10 Block subscription at any time, and you will have full access to the Service until the end of your billing period. We do not provide refunds for partial month subscriptions or unwatched 10 Block content. To cancel your subscription or update your Payment Method, go to Billing in the app settings and follow the instructions. Check with your Payment Method service provider for any surcharges for transactions or processing your subscription. We reserve the right to change our subscription pricing or plan at any time and with our sole and absolute discretion.</p>
